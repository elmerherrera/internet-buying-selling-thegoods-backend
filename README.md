## Summary
ORM can be used in an e-commerce backend to map the object-oriented model of the application to the underlying relational database. This can simplify the development process by allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing complex SQL statements to interact with the database.

For example, let's say an e-commerce backend has a Product class that represents a product in the online store. The Product class may have properties such as name, description, price, and quantity available. Using an ORM, the Product class can be mapped to a corresponding table in the database, where each property maps to a column in the table.

When a new product is added to the store, the developer can create a new instance of the Product class in the code and save it to the database using the ORM framework's save method. The ORM framework will automatically generate the appropriate SQL statements to insert the new record into the database.

When a customer purchases a product, the developer can update the quantity available using the ORM framework's update method, which will generate the appropriate SQL statements to update the corresponding record in the database.

ORM can also simplify queries by allowing developers to use object-oriented syntax to retrieve data from the database. For example, instead of writing a complex SQL query to retrieve all products in a particular category, the developer can use the ORM framework's built-in query methods to retrieve a list of Product objects that match the desired category.

Overall, using an ORM framework in an e-commerce backend can simplify the development process and reduce the amount of code needed to interact with the database.
